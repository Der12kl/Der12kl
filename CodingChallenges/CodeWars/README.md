## Challenges
Below is a list of challenges I have completed along with brief descriptions and direct links to the solutions within this repository.

### Sum Mixed Array
- **Description**: Given an array of integers as strings and numbers, return the sum of the array values as if all were numbers.
- **Solution**: [Sum Mixed Array.js](./Sum%20Mixed%20Array.js)

### Sum of Positive
- **Description**: You get an array of numbers, return the sum of all the positives ones.
- **Solution**: [Sum of Positive.js](./Sum%20of%20Positive.js)

### DNA to RNA Conversion
- **Description**: Given an array of integers as strings and numbers, the task is to return the sum of the array values as if all were numbers. This problem tests basic array manipulation and type conversion in JavaScript.
- **Solution**: [DNA to RNA Conversion.js](./DNA%20to%20RNA%20Conversion.js) 

### Plural
- **Description**: We need a simple function that determines if a plural is needed or not. It should take a number, and return true if a plural should be used with that number or false if not.
- **Solution**: [Plural.js](./Plural.js) 

### Are You Playing Banjo?
- **Description**: Create a function which answers the question "Are you playing banjo?". If your name starts with the letter "R" or lower case "r", you are playing banjo! Otherwise, they are not.
- **Solution**: [Are You Playing Banjo.js](./Are%20You%20Playing%20Banjo.js) 

### Counting sheep...
- **Description**: Given an array of sheep, where `true` means a sheep is present and `false` means a sheep is missing, create a function that counts the number of sheep present in the array. The function should also handle invalid values such as null or undefined.
- **Solution**: [Counting sheep....js](./Counting%20sheep....js) 

### Opposites Attract
- **Description**: Timmy & Sarah think they are in love. To determine if they are in love, they check if one flower has an even number of petals and the other has an odd number of petals. Write a function that takes the number of petals for each flower and returns true if one is even and the other is odd, false otherwise.
- **Solution**: [Opposites Attract.js](./Opposites%20Attract.js)
