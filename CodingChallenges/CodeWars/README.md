## Challenges
Below is a list of challenges I have completed along with brief descriptions and direct links to the solutions within this repository.

### Sum Mixed Array
- **Description**: Given an array of integers as strings and numbers, return the sum of the array values as if all were numbers.
- **Solution**: [Sum Mixed Array.js](./Sum%20Mixed%20Array.js)

### Sum of Positive
- **Description**: You get an array of numbers, return the sum of all the positives ones.
- **Solution**: [Sum of Positive.js](./Sum%20of%20Positive.js)

### DNA to RNA Conversion
- **Description**: Given an array of integers as strings and numbers, the task is to return the sum of the array values as if all were numbers. This problem tests basic array manipulation and type conversion in JavaScript.
- **Solution**: [DNA to RNA Conversion.js](./DNA%20to%20RNA%20Conversion.js)
