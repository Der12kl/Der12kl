<summary><strong>ü§ù Open Source Contributions</strong> (Click to expand)</summary>
<br>
I enjoy participating in open source projects. Here are some of the projects I've contributed to:

### Portfolio-1

I have been actively contributing to improving the [shaurya35/Portfolio-1](https://github.com/shaurya35/Portfolio-1), a project focused on demonstrating advanced CSS techniques and responsive design. Here are some of my contributions:

- **[Refactor Image Gallery CSS for Enhanced Responsiveness](https://github.com/shaurya35/Portfolio-1/pull/2)** - I redesigned the CSS for the image gallery to enhance its responsiveness. This pull request was particularly challenging due to the complex interactions between various CSS properties. Although it was eventually closed with unmerged commits, the process provided a deep dive into responsive design principles. (Project: [shaurya35/Portfolio-1](https://github.com/shaurya35/Portfolio-1))
- **[Refactor and Enhance Website Layout and Style](https://github.com/shaurya35/Portfolio-1/pull/3)** - This successful merge made significant improvements to the website's layout and style, emphasizing cleaner, semantic HTML and more efficient CSS. The changes have greatly improved the site's usability and visual appeal.

**Technologies Used:**
- HTML
- CSS
- Image Optimization Techniques

Here's a quick glimpse into the website refactor:
